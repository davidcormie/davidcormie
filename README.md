# David Cormie's git
A git hub with odd bits of data science code

## About me

Welcome to my git! I am a structural engineer with an interest in data analytics and data science.

## About this git
My git has some _very_ experimental repositories with various bits of code. It will be added to over time, but for now, the status is as follows:

- [x] get it working
- [x] share my git
- [x] write this readme
- [x] upload first public repository
- [ ] build out repositories over time with meaningful code on various topics

Thanks to the staff of @HyperionDev-com for their support during the Data Science bootcamp including setup of this git.
